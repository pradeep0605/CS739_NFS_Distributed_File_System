# Usage
To use the source code, you'll need to install grpc, FUSE and C++ Fuse wrapper functions.

* Use the link https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/INSTALL.md to download source code of grpc and install grpc install it. 
* Protocol buffers related information https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md.
* Use the link https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse to install libfuse.
* You'll need to `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/your/fuse-x.y.z/build/lib` for fuse to work.
* For c++, you'll need to use wrappers. https://github.com/jachappell/Fusepp Would give a small example of how to use wrappers. The source code integrates the use of grpc and Fuse c++ wrappers by modifying the Makefile. You can refer to it to understand how things work.
* For grpc related examples, take a look at https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/c.html#why-use-grpc. 



# Examples

This directory contains code examples for all the C-based gRPC implementations: C++, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, PHP, and C#. You can find examples and instructions specific to your
favourite language in the relevant subdirectory.

Examples for Go and Java gRPC live in their own repositories:

* [Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples)
* [Android Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples/android)
* [Go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples)
